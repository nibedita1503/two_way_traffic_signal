# two_way_traffic_signal
This project simulates a two-way traffic signal system using a Finite State Machine (FSM) designed purely with logic gatesâ€”no microcontrollers or high-level programming involved. It models real-world signal behavior at an intersection, alternating traffic flow between two directions based on a clock input and well-defined states.
